# Mummy & Daughter Bus Checker

A **mobile-friendly** web app to see which bus is best to catch near your preferred bus stops.

This exaple is designed for quick, real-time updates on two bus stops so my wife can get to the correct bus stop at time in the morning to drop off our daughter at nursery.

- **React Frontend** that highlights the best bus (soonest arrival).
- **Responsive Design** for iPhones and small screens.
- **Deployed to AWS Lambda + API Gateway** for a serverless, scalable solution.

## Tech Stack

- **Python + Flask** (backend)
- **React** (frontend)
- **Zappa** for serverless deployment on AWS
- **TFL StopPoint API** for real-time arrival info
- **OpenWeatherMap API** for real-time weather data
